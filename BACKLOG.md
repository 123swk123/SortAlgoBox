Backlog:

 * add 'crossverify' module? move all cross-verifying functionality to it?
 * implement missing unit tests
 * extract common logic from NativesCache and CLCache
 * figure out how to test JavaFX GUI
 * implement flexible central configuration
 * add support for LLVM/ Clang (that could e.g. make tests run quicker)
 * update copyright notices
