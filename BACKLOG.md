Backlog:

 * convert native C++ sorts to use items agents
 * use specialization in Scala items agents
 * implement guards in generated native C++ headers (eg enums)
 * decide on int8_t or uint8_t in native C++ number codecs and buffered I/O
 * implement missing unit tests
 * reorganize project structure to make more sense
 * figure out how to test JavaFX GUI
 * implement flexible central configuration
 * add support for LLVM/ Clang (that could e.g. make tests run quicker)
 * change license to Apache 2.0
